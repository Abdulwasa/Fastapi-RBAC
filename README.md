# Fastapi-RBAC
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a common authorization mechanism used to control access to resources in web applications, including FastAPI applications. FastAPI itself doesn't provide a built-in RBAC system, but you can implement RBAC in your FastAPI application using Python libraries and best practices.
